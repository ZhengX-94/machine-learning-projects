# machine learning projects
 This is the repo for my previous machine learning projects.

 - Uber ridership analysis in NY
This project use the Uber trips and weather data from April to June in 2014 in New York City. The data is cleaned and preprocessed and mainly output for visualization in Tableau. The GeoPandas library is used to transform the coordinates to the polygon. The pandas is used for merging the different tables and wrangling the data.
